Just lock this decision with a note:

📌 Design decision (locked):
EduHan will use a single app for Students and Parents with profile switching.
Parent profile access will require secondary authentication (PIN/biometric).
No schema changes required at this stage.

and we should allow single login device  not multiple devices login as then single studen tprofile can be used in multile devices and other users can use it effecting revenue

✅ Final Decision: Device Registration + Admin-Controlled Change (LOCK 🔒)
🔐 Core Rule (Final)

A user account can be used only on registered devices.
Changing device requires school admin approval.
One web login is allowed in parallel.

This gives you:

Strong revenue protection

School-level control

Zero misuse

Audit trail (very important for schools)

🧠 How this works conceptually
Device types we allow
Device Type	Allowed	Notes
📱 Mobile App (Primary)	✅ 1 only	Student / Parent
💻 Web App	✅ 1 session	Admin / Parent
🖥️ School Kiosk	✅ Special	RFID-only
❌ Second Mobile	❌	Needs approval

=================================================
📌 Final Locked Policy (Write this down)

EduHan Device Policy (Locked):

Mobile app access is restricted to registered devices only

One primary mobile device per user

Device change requires school admin approval

One concurrent web login is allowed

Profile switching (Student / Parent) is allowed on the same device

No more debate needed. This is the right call.
